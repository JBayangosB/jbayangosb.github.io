Today I pay nothing for my electricity and disconnected from gas in 2023. My home is also super powered with HomeAssistant! One day I hope to document all the steps I took to get to this point.</p><p>I love the outdoors and enjoy hiking and camping. I have been to many places around Australia and have seen some amazing sights. I also love combining technology with this hobby of mine and have built up a little bit of an electrical system for my camping setup. Coffee and Toast are never that far for me!</p><figure><img src=/images/the-hot-zone.jpg alt="Reading a book among cows"></figure><p>I am very curious about Artificial intelligence and understanding how it works, so far I&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface by training my own LORA in this <a href=https://jbayangosb.github.io/posts/train-flux-lora/>blog post</a>. There&rsquo;s a good chance it is now outdated but at the time it was a great learning experience.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also a massive gamer with some of my favourite games being the Witcher 3, Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077 and the Mass Effect series. There&rsquo;s more games I like but I could list those endlessly! I also enjoy playing all kinds of board games. Some favourite pastimes have been <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_%28board_game%29 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Dixit,</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Carcassonne</a> and <a href=https://www.secrethitler.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Secret Hitler.</a></p><p>I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href=https://boundinteractive.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Bound</a>.
